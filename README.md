# face-to-cursor
This program moves cursor based on live face movements taken from the webcam and displays a live video of face position being captured.

Try to experiment with the starting cursor position, as the functionality of it depends on the screen size.
Also, in "main.py" there is an attempt to draw a rectangle around potentially found smile. It is there for further development, hopefully including the option of clicking.
